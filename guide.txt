Next time you work on the project, you just:

on powershell:

cd path\to\expense-tracker
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
(Or the activate.bat version if you’re in CMD.)

Then you can run Python or Flask as before — no need to run pip install -r requirements.txt again.

requirements.txt is just for sharing or recreating the environment on a different machine (or if you delete your .venv folder).
